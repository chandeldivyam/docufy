## Add a domain

1. Open Domains on your site
2. Enter your domain (e.g., [docs.example.com](http://docs.example.com)) and click Add Domain

## DNS instructions

| **Domain type**                | **Record** | **Host** | **Target**              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| Subdomain (`docs.example.com`) | `CNAME`    | `docs`   | `cname.vercel-dns.com.` |

- Wait for DNS to propagate (can take up to 24 hours)

## Verify and TLS

- Click `Check now` to verify; SSL certs are issued automatically once DNS is correct

## Remove a domain

- From the domain list, use `Remove`; this detaches it from your site

## FAQs

- **What records do I add?**
  Subdomain (`docs.example.com`): CNAME pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- **How long does verification take?**
  DNS changes may take up to 24 hours globally. After records propagate, click `Check now`; TLS is issued automatically.
- **Can I use both a primary host and custom domains?**
  Yes. Your site always has a primary host for quick previews; custom domains can be added any time.
- **I verified but still see HTTP issues**
  Some corporate networks enforce strict SSL/headers. Ensure your reverse proxy (if any) forwards `x-forwarded-*` headers intact and doesn’t strip required content types.
- **Can I remove a domain?**
  Yes. Removing a domain detaches it from the site; the primary host remains available.
