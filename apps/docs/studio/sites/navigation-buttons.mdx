Buttons let you surface key links like “Changelog”, “Community”, or “Contact”.

## Define buttons

1. Open Navigation Buttons in the site page
2. Click `Add Button`; set label and href (internal route like `/guides/getting-started` or an external URL)
3. Choose a position (see table below)
4. Reorder with arrows; delete to remove

## Positions and targets

| Topbar (Left)    | Contextual internal links                     |

  Internal routes should match published routes (e.g., `/<space>/<path>`). Buttons are versioned with each publish.
