## What’s managed

- API Tag and Endpoint documents generated under an API Spec are managed by the spec
- Managed nodes are read‑only: you cannot manually change title, parent, slug, or delete them

## How to change

1. Edit your OpenAPI (e.g., summary, tags, paths)
2. Re‑process the API Spec — Docufy updates titles, parents, creates new items, and removes deleted ones
