| **Type**                  | **Where**    | **Notes**              |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Group                     | Root only    | Organizes content      |
| Page                      | Anywhere     | Rich content           |
| API Spec / Tag / Endpoint | Spec subtree | Generated from OpenAPI |

## Create

- New page: from the tree header or a node’s ••• menu
- New group: from the tree header (adds at the root)

## Reorder and nest

- Drag before/after a sibling to change order
- Drag “inside” a target to nest beneath it
- Restrictions: Groups must remain at the root level. Managed API items cannot be moved.

## Slugs and ranks

- Slugs are generated from titles and must be unique among siblings
- When you rename, the slug updates and de‑conflicts automatically
- Ordering is durable — drops compute a new rank between neighbors to avoid renumbering the whole tree

## Keyboard

- `Alt+Up/Down` from the editor moves to the previous/next visible page in reading order

  Keep top‑level groups small and descriptive. Avoid deep nesting when a linear sequence works
  better (use Prev/Next).
