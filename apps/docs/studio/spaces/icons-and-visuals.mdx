## Pick an icon

- Click the icon placeholder next to a page title (or use the ••• menu) to open the picker
- Icons help scanning large trees and appear in published navigation

## Recommendations

- Groups: use “folder” or section‑appropriate icons
- Pages: match the topic (e.g., rocket for “Getting started”)
- API sections: reserve icons for top nodes; endpoints already show method badges on the site

## Publishing notes

- Icons render on the live site; we optimize them during publish for consistent sizing
