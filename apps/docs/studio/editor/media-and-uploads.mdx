## Videos

- Paste or upload supported video files (MP4/WebM/QuickTime)
- Embedded similarly to images; posters are supported when provided

## Limits and tips

- Keep individual images under 20 MB for smooth editing and publishing
- Prefer modern formats (WebP/AVIF for images, MP4/WebM for videos)

## Optimization

### Images

- Prefer WebP or AVIF for UI screenshots and illustrations
- Keep images ≤ 20 MB for smooth editing and publishing
- Resize large screenshots to the maximum display size before uploading

### Videos

- Prefer MP4 (H.264) or WebM (VP9/AV1) for broad compatibility
- Target ≤ 40 MB per video; trim and compress when possible
- Provide a poster frame if your video doesn’t show a clear first frame

### General tips

- Use fewer large media blocks per page; split long tutorials across multiple pages with Prev/Next
- Reuse media across pages via consistent assets if your process allows
