Docufy rewrites local assets to CDN URLs and uploads them to Blob during publish.

## How resolution works

- Absolute URLs (`https://…`) and `data:` URIs are used as-is.
- Paths starting with `/` resolve from the config directory.
- Relative paths resolve from the document’s folder, scoped within the config/root directory tree.
- Path traversal outside the config directory is blocked.

## Supported tags

- Markdown images: `![alt](./img/diagram.png)`
- `<img src="...">` and `<video src="...">` tags (with `source` children).
- Width/height/controls attributes are preserved.

## Recommendations

- Keep assets in a nearby folder (e.g., `docs/assets/` or `docs/img/`).
- Optimize size (SVG or compressed PNG/WebP) for faster uploads.
- Use descriptive alt text; it’s kept in the rendered HTML.
- Avoid huge binaries; Blob supports large files, but deploys are faster when assets are small.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing asset? Ensure the file path exists on the chosen branch and is inside the config/root directory.
- 404 after publish? Check that the MDX path casing matches the repo file exactly.
- If an external image fails to load, switch to a repo-relative asset so Docufy can upload and cache it.
