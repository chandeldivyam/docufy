Keep Docs as Code deterministic by choosing the right branch strategy.

## Recommended patterns

- **Docs-only branch**: use `docs-main` (or similar) for published docs; developers can merge from `main` as needed.
- **Separate staging site**: create a second Docufy site pointed at a staging branch (e.g., `docs-staging`).
- **Feature branches**: for larger rewrites, point a temporary site at `feature/docs-new-ia`; delete when merged.

## Config path per branch

- You can keep multiple configs (e.g., `docufy.config.json` and `docufy.staging.config.json`). Set the appropriate path on each site.
- Avoid sharing one site across branches; the build always uses the pinned branch+path.

## Determinism

- Builds pin to the commit SHA of the selected branch at publish time.
- Asset and content blobs are hashed; unchanged files are reused.
- Keep large assets stable and avoid `../` path tricks to reduce surprises.

## What to avoid

- Mixing Studio and GitHub sources on one site (not supported).
- Editing published docs in Studio when the site is GitHub-backed (source of truth should be your repo).
- Changing branch/config path right before a publish without re-validating.
