Use the GitHub App to turn a repo into a Docufy site. This is required for Docs as Code.

## Install and authorize

- From Docufy, click **Connect GitHub** and follow the install flow.
- Select the organization/user and repos that contain your docs. You can always widen access later in GitHub settings.
- Private repos work; Docufy stores installation metadata and only fetches the files you reference.

## Create the site (GitHub source)

1. **Create site → Source: GitHub.**
2. Pick the installation, repository, branch, and `docufy.config.json` path (e.g., `docufy.config.json` or `docs/config/docufy.config.json`).
3. Save. Docufy validates and syncs: branding, theme tokens, and navigation buttons are pulled from the config.

### GitHub metadata stored on the site

- Installation ID, repo full name, branch, and config path.
- Config validation status (`queued` → `running` → `success`/`failed`) with errors surfaced in the site header.
- Latest synced config SHA and timestamp.

## Verify with config check

- After saving, Docufy reads the config file, validates the schema, and previews a snippet (first ~2 KB).
- If validation fails, the UI shows the issues (e.g., missing required fields, path traversal). Fix in GitHub, commit, and re-sync.

## Change config path or branch later

- Open the site → Settings → GitHub section.
- Update branch or config path; Docufy re-validates automatically.
- Use this to point to a different folder (`/docs/` vs `/handbook/`) or to stage changes on a feature branch.
