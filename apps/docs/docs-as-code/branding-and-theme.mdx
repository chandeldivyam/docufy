Logos, favicon, and theme tokens live in your config and sync automatically from GitHub.

## Branding assets

- `branding.logo.light` / `branding.logo.dark`: recommended PNG/SVG. If only one is provided, it’s used for both themes.
- `branding.favicon`: SVG or PNG.
- Relative paths resolve from the config directory; assets are uploaded to Blob and rewritten to CDN URLs. External URLs are passed through.
- Keep assets in your repo (e.g., `logo/` folder) and optimize size for faster builds.

## Theme tokens

- `theme.version`: currently `1`.
- `light` / `dark`: CSS custom properties (e.g., `"--primary": "oklch(...)"`).
- `vars`: additional global variables for layout or component tweaks.
- Tokens sync during config validation and are packaged into `theme.json` on publish.

## Layout

- `site.layout`: `sidebar-dropdown` (collapsible navigation) or `tabs` (spaces as top tabs).
- `space.style`: optional override per space if you want a tabbed API area and a sidebar docs area.

## Tips

- Provide both light and dark logos for better contrast.
- Reuse `--primary` across light/dark for brand consistency; adjust chroma/lightness per theme.
- Favicon should be square and simple; avoid large file sizes.
- When changing logos or tokens, commit the change and re-sync/publish to propagate.
