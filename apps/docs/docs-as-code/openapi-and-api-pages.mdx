Generate API reference pages by pointing a tree node to an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 file.

## Authoring an API spec node

- Set `type: "api_spec"` and `path` to a JSON/YAML OpenAPI file in your repo.
- Example:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "API",
    "type": "api_spec",
    "path": "api/petstore.yaml",
    "icon": "braces"
  }
  ```
- The file is uploaded to Blob and reused across builds by hash.

## What Docufy generates

- A page for the spec itself (metadata, download link).
- A page for each tag (if tags exist), in the order defined in the top-level `tags` array; otherwise alphabetical.
- A page for each operation (method + path) under its tag, or under the spec if untagged.
- Routes follow `/api-reference/{space}/{trail}` and inherit the parent icon.

## Writing better specs

- Provide `summary` and `description` on operations; these become titles and body text.
- Use tags to create sensible groupings; keep tag names short.
- Keep operation titles unique within a tag to avoid slug collisions; Docufy de-dupes but short names read better.
- Valid JSON/YAML only—Docufy validates and will fail the build if the spec cannot parse.

## Updating specs

- Commit changes to the tracked branch; publish to regenerate pages.
- If you move the spec path, update the config node `path`.
- Large specs are fine; Docufy streams processing and reuses blobs when the hash is unchanged.
