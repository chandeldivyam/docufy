  Install the Docufy GitHub App, point a site at your repo/branch, add a `docufy.config.json`, and
  publish.
</Callout>

## Steps

1. **Install the GitHub App**
   - From Docufy, choose Install GitHub App and grant access to the repo that holds your docs.
   - Keep note of the branch you want to ship from (e.g., `docs-main`).

2. **Add `docufy.config.json` to your repo**
   - Place it at the repo root (or any folder) and reference it when creating the site.
   - Add a basic tree that points to at least one MDX file. Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "site": { "name": "ACME Docs" },
  "navigation": {
    "spaces": [
      {
        "slug": "docs",
        "name": "Docs",
        "rootDir": "docs",
        "entry": "introduction.mdx",
        "tree": [{ "title": "Introduction", "path": "introduction.mdx" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. **Create a Docufy site and select GitHub**
   - Choose the installation, repo, branch, and the config path you just added.
   - Save. Docufy validates the config and pulls branding/theme/buttons automatically.

4. **Add content**
   - Commit MDX files under the rootDir you configured (`docs/` in the example).
   - Use the built-in components (`Callout`, `Card`, `Columns`) and fenced code blocks.

5. **Publish**
   - Open the site → Deploys → Publish. Watch items processed and reused.
   - Click the primary host link to verify. Add a custom domain when ready.

## What happens during publish

- We pin to the selected branch, fetch your config, and normalize paths relative to it.
- Assets referenced in MDX are uploaded to Blob and rewritten to CDN URLs.
- MDX is rendered with GitHub-flavored markdown, headings get anchors, code is highlighted.
- OpenAPI specs (`type: "api_spec"`) generate tag pages and endpoint pages automatically.
- Manifest, nav tree, and theme are written; domains are updated to the new build.
