Publishing turns your GitHub branch into a static Docufy site with search and assets.

## Publish flow

1. Site → Deploys → Publish.
2. Docufy pulls the selected branch and config path, validates, and begins processing.
3. Progress shows items processed, reused blobs, and bytes written. Missing files are logged.
4. Manifest, tree, and theme are written; domain pointers move to the new build.

## Rollbacks

- Re-publish from an earlier commit on the same branch (or temporarily set the branch to that commit via a dedicated branch).
- Because blobs are hashed, unchanged pages and assets are reused; rollbacks are quick.
- Keep the config compatible—if you removed paths from the tree, ensure the older commit still matches the current config path.

## Safe practices

- Publish only after config validation is green.
- Avoid force-pushing over the tracked branch; use merge or fast-forward to keep history.
- For emergency fixes, create a hotfix branch, point the site to it, publish, then revert to the main branch after merging.

## Custom domains

- Add domains in the site Domains tab. After DNS is verified, republish so the new build is served at the domain.
- SSL is handled automatically; check status in the Domains tab.
- Changing domains does not require content changes, but a fresh publish ensures pointers are up to date.
