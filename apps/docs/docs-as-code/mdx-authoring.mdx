Docufy renders GitHub-flavored MDX with built-in components, syntax highlighting, and sanitized HTML.

## Markdown + MDX

- Supports GFM: tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks.
- MDX JSX is allowed; unknown uppercase components render as inline code to surface typos. Lowercase tags are treated as HTML.
- Raw HTML is merged and sanitized; heading IDs are preserved (no `user-content-` prefix).

## Components you can use

- `<Callout title="Heads up" icon="alert-circle" color="#f97316">Body</Callout>`
- `<Card title="Start here" icon="rocket" href="/docs/intro">Body</Card>` (`horizontal` for a wide layout)
- `<Columns cols={3}>…</Columns>` or `<CardGroup cols={2}>…</CardGroup>`
- Add your own by extending the MDX components map in code; unknown names stay visible as code.

## Code blocks

````md
```ts
const hello = 'world';
```
````

```

- Highlighted with Shiki (`light-plus` / `slack-dark`).
- `data-language` is added for downstream styling.
- Keep fences short and focused; prefer language hints (`ts`, `bash`, `json`).

## Headings, TOC, and search

- Headings get permalinks and feed the table of contents.
- Plain text is collected for search indexing. Write descriptive headings and lead sentences.

## Authoring tips

- Keep titles concise; slugs are trimmed to 80–120 chars.
- Use callouts for warnings, requirements, or next steps.
- Break long guides into multiple pages to keep navigation scannable.
- Use relative links between docs (`../guides/setup.mdx`); they are rewritten to CDN URLs during publish.
