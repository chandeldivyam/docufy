Common issues and how to fix them when publishing from GitHub.

## Config validation fails

- Check the error list in the GitHub section of the site.
- Typical causes: missing required fields, invalid enum values, trailing commas, path traversal (`../` outside config directory).
- Fix in GitHub, commit, then re-sync or publish again.

## Missing files

- Logged during publish as “Missing configured GitHub doc paths.”
- Ensure the path exists on the selected branch and is inside `rootDir`.
- Case matters; match file names exactly.

## Assets not loading

- Ensure asset paths are relative to the doc or start with `/` from the config directory.
- External images failing? Move them into the repo so Docufy can upload and serve them.
- Very large binaries may be slow; compress or split them.

## OpenAPI parsing errors

- Docufy requires valid OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 JSON or YAML. Run a linter locally (e.g., `swagger-cli validate`).
- Keep `operationId`/`summary` unique per tag to avoid confusing slugs.

## Icon not showing

- Use valid Lucide names (e.g., `rocket`, `book-open`, `git-branch`). If an icon is missing, Docufy skips it and keeps the page.
- Remove unknown icon names or replace with a known one.

## Publish stuck or failed

- Check Repo Syncs and Deploys tabs for the last error.
- Ensure GitHub App permissions are intact and the branch exists.
- If a build repeatedly fails, try a smaller change: revert a recent spec/asset change to isolate the issue.
