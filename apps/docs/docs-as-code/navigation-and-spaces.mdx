Spaces map to top-level sections in your docs (product lines, personas, environments). The tree defines side navigation, page order, and breadcrumbs.

## Spaces

- Each space needs a unique `slug` and `name`.
- `style`: inherit from `site.layout` or override per space.
- `rootDir`: base folder for all `path` values in the space. Keep it scoped (e.g., `docs`, `handbook`, `api`).
- `entry`: default landing page route within the space; if omitted, the first page is used.

## Trees

- Order is defined by the array order. Use nested groups to create collapsible sections.
- `group` nodes have no content but keep structure clean.
- Pages (`path` set) get routes under `/{space}/{trail}`; API pages use `/api-reference/{space}/{trail}`.

### Examples

```json
{
  "slug": "docs",
  "name": "Docs",
  "rootDir": "docs",
  "tree": [
    { "title": "Overview", "path": "overview.mdx", "icon": "book-open" },
    {
      "title": "Guides",
      "icon": "map",
      "children": [
        { "title": "Setup", "path": "guides/setup.mdx" },
        { "title": "Deploy", "path": "guides/deploy.mdx" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Icons and ordering

- Use Lucide icon names (`rocket`, `book-open`, `git-branch`) for visual cues. Missing icons are skipped safely.
- Sibling slugs are de-duped automatically; you can reuse titles without clashing.
- To move a page, change its position in `tree`; Docufy rebuilds routes in order.

## Tips

- Keep sections shallow: 2–3 levels deep is ideal.
- Use `entry` for each space so visitors land on the intended start page.
- Group API specs separately from guides to avoid clutter.
- Avoid very long titles; slugs are trimmed and must stay unique.
