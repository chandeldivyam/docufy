Run safe previews for docs changes by pointing a site at a feature or staging branch.

## Staging site pattern

- Create a second Docufy site with the same repo/config path but a staging branch (e.g., `docs-staging`).
- Publish staging first; verify links, assets, and API pages.
- Merge staging into your production branch and publish the production site.

## Feature previews

- For big IA changes, spin up a temporary site:
  - Source: GitHub → choose the feature branch.
  - Config path: same as prod.
  - Publish and share the host link internally.
- Delete the preview site after merging to keep orgs clean.

## Tips

- Keep config paths identical between staging and prod to minimize drift.
- Use feature flags in content (conditional sections) sparingly; prefer branch-based changes.
- If you store assets separately, avoid overwriting shared filenames; hashes are reused across builds.

## What’s reused

- Blob uploads are immutable and reused by hash. If your preview branch reuses assets, they won’t be re-uploaded.
- Search indexing is isolated per site+build, so staging experiments won’t affect production search.
